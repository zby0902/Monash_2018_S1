    "# Parsing CSV & JSON Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to advances in technologies for data storage, data from various sources is always stored in different formats\n",
    "and file types. \n",
    "Some data formats store data in a way that can be easily handled by a machine, such as CSV, JSON, and XML.\n",
    "Those formats are usually referred to as machine-readable formats.\n",
    "In contrast, some other data formats or file types store data in a way meant to be read by a human \n",
    "using front-end desktop tools.\n",
    "Those formats or file types are often referred to as hard-to-parse formats.\n",
    "We will use a series of examples to demonstrate how to extract data stored in \n",
    "both machine-readable and hard-to-parse formats,\n",
    "and then store the extracted data in formats that can be easily adopted by the downstream data wranngling tasks.\n",
    "This chapter will cover how to read the common machine-readable formats:\n",
    "* **CSV**: Comma Separated Values\n",
    "* **JSON**: JavaScript Object Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, the two formats togeather with XML are the best available resource while you are scraping data from\n",
    "the web or requesting data directly from an organization or agency. \n",
    "They are more easily used and ingested by programming languages, like Python.\n",
    "Our suggestion is that you should try your best to get data in these formats, before you start looking\n",
    "into other formats that might be hard to parse, like PDFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways of reading and storing data in those formats, \n",
    "which depends on the programming language you use.\n",
    "Here we are going to focus on Python.\n",
    "Searching the Internet, you will find there are a lot of online tutorials on handling data stored in different\n",
    "data formats with Python.\n",
    "We suggest the following:\n",
    "* \"*Data Loading, Storage, and File Formats*\", Chapter 6 of \"**Python for Data Analysis**\": This chapter covers reading files in a variety of formats, loading data from databases and interacting with Internet via APIs. Please read pages 155-166, and download and run the Python scripts from [the author's github site](https://github.com/pydata/pydata-book). 📖\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this chapter was downloaded from\n",
    "[data.gov.au](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Transport-Movement/Melbourne-bike-share/tdvh-n9dv). \n",
    "It is available in the following formats: CSV, JSON, XML, RDF, etc.\n",
    "The first two formats are used, i.e., the following two files\n",
    "* Melbourne_bike_share.csv\n",
    "* Melbourne_bike_share.json\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, you will learn how to scrape data from the two \n",
    "example files, and store the extracted data into Pandas DataFrame. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example scenario\n",
    "Assume that you are going to analyze and predict bicycle hubway station status to answer the following questions:\n",
    "* What do usage patterns look like with respect to specific stations and how that translates to imbalances in the system?\n",
    "* Can we integrate these explanatory variables and these usage patterns into a predictive algorithm that would predict empty and full stations in the near future?\n",
    "* What form should that algorithm take?\n",
    "* How do environmental variables affect the future state of Hubway stations?\n",
    "\n",
    "See <a href=\"http://cs109hubway.github.io/classp/\"><font color=\"red\">Predicting Hubway Stations status in Boston</font></a> for more discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step we have to do is to acquire the hub station data and as well as weather data. Here, for demonstration purpose, we use the Melbourne bike share data published by the government. The files have been downloaded and come along with this notebook.\n",

    "## 1. Parsing CSV file\n",
    "A CSV is a Comma Separated Values file, which allows data to be saved in a tabular format.\n",
    "Each row of the file is a data record; each column is a field (or an attribute).\n",
    "Each data record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas.\n",
    "As one of the most popular file formats,\n",
    "it is supported by any spreadsheet programs, such as \n",
    "Microsoft Excel, Open Office Calc, and Google Spreadsheets,\n",
    "Because of its simplicity,\n",
    "it differs from other spreadsheet file types, such as Excel, in that one can only store a single sheet in a file. \n",
    "It cannot be used to store cell, columns or row styling, figures and formulas.\n",
