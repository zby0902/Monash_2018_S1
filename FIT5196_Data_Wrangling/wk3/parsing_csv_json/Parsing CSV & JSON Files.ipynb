    "# Parsing CSV & JSON Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to advances in technologies for data storage, data from various sources is always stored in different formats\n",
    "and file types. \n",
    "Some data formats store data in a way that can be easily handled by a machine, such as CSV, JSON, and XML.\n",
    "Those formats are usually referred to as machine-readable formats.\n",
    "In contrast, some other data formats or file types store data in a way meant to be read by a human \n",
    "using front-end desktop tools.\n",
    "Those formats or file types are often referred to as hard-to-parse formats.\n",
    "We will use a series of examples to demonstrate how to extract data stored in \n",
    "both machine-readable and hard-to-parse formats,\n",
    "and then store the extracted data in formats that can be easily adopted by the downstream data wranngling tasks.\n",
    "This chapter will cover how to read the common machine-readable formats:\n",
    "* **CSV**: Comma Separated Values\n",
    "* **JSON**: JavaScript Object Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, the two formats togeather with XML are the best available resource while you are scraping data from\n",
    "the web or requesting data directly from an organization or agency. \n",
    "They are more easily used and ingested by programming languages, like Python.\n",
    "Our suggestion is that you should try your best to get data in these formats, before you start looking\n",
    "into other formats that might be hard to parse, like PDFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways of reading and storing data in those formats, \n",
    "which depends on the programming language you use.\n",
    "Here we are going to focus on Python.\n",

    "Assume that you are going to analyze and predict bicycle hubway station status to answer the following questions:\n",
    "* What do usage patterns look like with respect to specific stations and how that translates to imbalances in the system?\n",
