    "This part discusses the basic and essential practical steps for integrating data from various sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dealing with data from different sources requires essentially the integration between these sources to have a full information view. For example, if you collect data about house pricing separately in each suburb, you might need to \"concatenate\" data together to get a view of the house prices all over Victoria and even Australia. However, each data collection might have different attributes. How to merge them together to get a complete yet precise (with no duplication) presentation of the whole collection? Consider another example for sales department, when you have customer details in one table and product details in another table. How can we use Python (pandas library) to execute the join between the two DataFrame and manage the many to many relationship. This is exactly about implementing database techniques for merging tables using python on a general data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Panda library has offered methods to manage the data integration task. In the following, we will discuss each method with examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are four ways to merge/combine between different DataFrames in pandas: concatenating, appending, merging and joining. Each has its own use cases and best practice. We present concatenating and appending in this tutorial, the other two methods will be discussed in the next tutorial. In all of these methods, we assume data is fetched or scrapped from the web (as explained in the Part A) or it is stored locally on the machine. We also assume that the data from each source is stored in a DataFrame structure. We start first with the easiest way for merging DataFrame with concatenating.\n",

The outer option is the default gets the union of data and grantees zero loss. The previous example shows the outer join of df2 and df4.  On the other hand, inner gets the intersection between the two DataFrames. Last but not least, the “join_axes” argument is used for joining with a specific index. "
