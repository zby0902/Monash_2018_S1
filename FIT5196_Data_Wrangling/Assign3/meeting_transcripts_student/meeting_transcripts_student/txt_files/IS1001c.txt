 Okay .
 Mm-hmm .
 So we are here for the concept design meeting .
 So , we will first start by summarizing the mm the previous meeting and the decision we've taken .
 Uh I will take notes during this meeting so uh that you can uh look at my uh folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards .
 So each of you will uh show us the various investigation they've done during uh previous uh hours .
 We'll then t take decision in concert and then uh uh we will uh define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting .
 So , last time we decided to have a simple interface .
 We also decided to have a wheel to change channel previous channel button . Channel digit uh buttons should be uh protected by plastic cover or something for the remote control to look very simple .
 We have also button for volume , and to switch on off the T_V_ .
 We have also uh the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no L_C_D_ no voice features .
**********
 So now uh we will have three presentations . So the conceptual specification by Industrial Designer , the specification of the U_I_ by or U_I_ okay . And uh the last point is uh trend watching by Market Expert .
 Abdul al-Hasred is my name .
 So maybe we can start with uh industrial design .
 So this is the presentation .
 Uh , I_D_ you want ?
 Maybe I can switch slide uh on your request .
 Yeah .
 I only v have three slides , so . I just look at the mm
 um just this .
 On some web pages to find some documentation and I think a remote control is , as I s mentioned previously ,
 Yeah .
 you just have a a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button
 and in our case we are using a um a wheel control .
 So uh uh I was looking basically for that chip , which is uh very very standard , and uh I just looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button .
 And um yeah we can change directly . In fact I have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control . The push button are usually extremely cheap , but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 Mm-hmm .
 And I think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not if if we could combine something with the push button .
 Okay .
 Uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button .
 Yeah .
 But is it a significant price on the whole remote control ? Because we can afford up to twelve Euros for the price of the remote control .
 Mm .
 Yeah .
 Yeah I I th
 So will will will this with uh including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be uh lower than twelve Euros to produce ?
 But I don't think that uh we should
 We should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money . But
 Yeah .
 Okay
 Also have to say Did you receive the email about the voice recognition ?
 Um that's all yeah . I haven't chec
 No ?
 You received something
 Yeah . You we uh an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed .
 Hmm .
 Says
 Yeah . It says that ri right now they just use it to uh to record uh answers to particular questions . But I guess it could be
 And could it be adapted ?
 I guess it's possible . I mean instead of recording the answers you can just uh record uh something simpler like a command .
 Okay and there can uh recognize some commands and stuff ?
 Yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff , so if they already have it as uh as a chip
 Okay .
 Yeah .
 then we we could use it .
 Okay maybe we can just uh listen to this presentation and then take decision later on according to those news .
 Okay .
 Mm-hmm . Yeah but I think it's yeah Sorry , I haven't written my personal references . Um the I I just want to mention the the problem of the the r
 wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button , and if we could reduce that .
 Okay .
 We we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button .
 Mm-hmm .
 I have a question about that actually . Um , what is the purpose of the light ?
 Just to to make something which is uh slightly more design that uh a squarey box with a rubber
 Is
 You can easily find the button in the dark or so ?
 But
 But in th in the dark uh
 Yeah but is going to be always turned on , the light ?
 It will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control I think , no ?
 But if you move it then you have it , you don't need to find it .
 Hmm .
 You can see the buttons better , of course . Yeah .
 Yeah . Yeah .
 Yeah . True .
 Yeah . Actually .
 But if you move it then you have to have some sensor to when you move it to detect your movement .
 As soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light .
 Yeah , but you need another sensor for that , right ?
 Yeah . Again .
 Yeah no it's too expensive .
 I don't think that this is really expensive , but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but uh the bill starts to be
 Okay .
 Mm .
 Extra . Yeah , okay .
 Mm .
 Yeah , but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so , yeah .
 First of all I was thinking to have a a continuous light and you w when t you you you you press the on button you have the light on your remote control , when you want to turn off your device
 Mm .
 Mm-hmm .
 But it can be uh battery consuming , no ?
 To have the light always on ?
 Yeah , a little bit .
 A little bit .
 Mm .
 Well we will discuss that after maybe
 Yeah .
**********
 Okay . So uh my one , it uh should be in the shared folder .
 the other presentations .
 Yeah .
 So .
 It was last time I saw it .
 And it is .
 Okay .
 So , just move to the next slide .
 Okay .
 So basically want very simple , right ? That's the major idea , as simple as possible .
 Yeah . Yeah .
 So I just look at some current designs uh on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls . And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple . And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler .
 Yeah .
 Um . So .
 And also does it uh fit well in hand ? Because it was uh th your wrist problem with the usage .
 Yeah . Well this these uh these remotes are quite big , so go to the next page , so .
 We have all these buttons as you can see , but most of them , we just need the ones in the middle .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 So , from the bottom or whatever is there , uh the uh the numbers and then the top , uh until the ten also , this middle part , and on the left one is exactly the same . So it's basically more or less how we would like it , with a big volume control , big channel control , and mute and power , yeah ? These are the basic thing .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . So it's only the central part .
 So basically , w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two .
 Yeah . With a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part .
 Yeah , if you have , for example I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb . It could be on the right side , for example . Yeah . Because we don't have these input buttons and this other stuff that they have .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 And I think that the plastic cover is not very good uh idea because
 Okay .
 you open it , it can break , you ca you can do various things . Uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way .
 Okay . S
 Okay . Will be down or Okay .
 So that they're separate a bit , yeah . Uh and it's easy to press the other the big buttons , but uh , it's not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either .
 Mm . Yeah , I think that if you put the cover it will be even more difficult for the user .
 Okay .
 Alright , you won't yeah .
 Usually what I have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally don't mess with , like buttons for t uh tuning the channels and stuff like that . Yeah . That you want to protect a bit .
 Okay .
 And I think it's uh it's reasonable .
 Okay .
 So , I don't think
 Yeah , this is just the the wheel . We could use the some wheels can be pushed down , could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want .
 Mm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Uh so we could just basically use one just wheel and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case .
 Yeah .
 Maybe the wheel will be a good advantage over our competitors .
 Mm-hmm .
 Because otherwise it's pretty standard apart the fact that it's very simple .
 So maybe it's worse to uh to have more expense on that's that aspect .
 To s
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah , I guess the market researcher will tell us all about that .
 Okay .
 So we can move to the Is there any question ? For
 designer of user interface ? or we can move to the next part , maybe , and discuss afterwards ?
 Okay .
**********
 Okay , I can go ?
 Can I ?
 Yeah .
 So now the recent investigation we we have done fo of the remote control um .
 So , the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel . And um the second aspect is uh that the remote control should be uh technological innovative .
 And the third most important aspect is to to is that the co remote control should be easy to use .
 Okay .
 So , are things we are we have uh speak about before . Yeah . And um so you you can go
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 after .
 And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends , uh fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes , and furnitures .
 So , maybe if our remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form something like that , or
 Okay .
 I support an apple .
 And the mm the material is expected to be spongy .
 Uh I don't know which material can be spongy , and if you
 Yeah .
 This is good also for
 Well , wou wou I think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing , it it would work , right ? Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . I think it is good also f to have a spongy material , yeah . Yeah , because it's robust .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 You can throw it to the television .
 Okay It's robust , yeah .
 Yeah . Me too .
 Hey that's a cool one . We could say that if you throw it , you have a sensor , and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off .
 When it d uh takes a shock .
 Not good .
 Yeah uh sorry ?
 Ah it's okay . I know that they do that for alarm clock also .
 An and and uh this uh you can yeah you can say that . You ca uh you can go uh before , before , yes . And you know here the more iz important aspect is the fancy look and feel , after is uh technological innovative , and after the easy to use .
 Yeah .
 No .
 Yeah .
 Before ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 I think it's innovative to use the mm the wheel because I think no one else has . Has it ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah that's why Yeah that's why I think we have to keep that if it's possible .
 Yeah . I think it's it makes it both easy and both innos innovative . So I think it's a good aspect and it should be kept .
 Mm-hmm .
 Innovative . Mm .
 How do we make it look cool is the question .
 Cool , fancy ?
 Yeah .
 We have to make it l look like a fruit or vegetable .
 Yeah . Mm .
 Maybe uh um a colour that remember some fruit uh , things like that .
 What about um
 Oh , colour , yeah .
 Well the obvious thing is a banana , I guess .
 Oh i i
 Maybe yeah .
 I thought about a a pear , for example . You know the pear , is like that and it's it's easy to to have in in hand and uh
 Yeah , and it's ergonomic as well .
 Yeah .
 A pear .
 The banana is also ergonomic .
 Yeah . Maybe pear yeah or something like that .
 Or a fruit like that . I dunno .
 Yeah . We can discuss that uh . D D Is is there anything you want to add ?
 Is there any fruit that is spongy ?
 I don't think so . I think we we can have like yeah a pear is good , fit well , or banana as you told .
 Yeah .
 And for maybe look and feel , what about a a piece of ice ,
 Something like that .
 with blue L_E_D_ inside ?
 But that's not in the trend . . The trend is spongy , and vegetable fruits .
 You can make it um
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 It's not hard , the metal .
 Yeah .
 I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well .
 Plastic .
 Yep .
 So , I think we can keep the wheel
 because it's uh easy , it's innovative , even if the cost is a bit higher , and we also have to find a , so , a fruit like pear or banana wit uh any others idea you have .
 Yeah .
 What kind of fr fruit would you like to to control your T_V_ with ?
 Mm .
 Odi
 Banana I think , it's a nice idea .
 Banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then .
 Because
 But
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 You y you don't use the banana when the banana is curving like that , but when the banana is curving like that , with the wheel on the top and to control , and here you have a a push button to
 Two of the button , yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 But you don't have
 I think it's a good idea , yeah .
 Yeah so you can just have uh just have this curve , yeah , and you move uh your hand here to press the buttons and then you move uh on the other side . So you can have it on on two sides and it'll be cool , no ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . I think it's a good design and it's innovative as well then . Maybe we can keep the banana . And it will be very easy to find .
 You can put also vibrator inside .
 And everybody knows what is a banana . Basically . If you if you start with uh fancy fruits and fra s and tha
 Yeah .
 Ah-ha . You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company . Yeah .
 Oh , yeah
 Yeah .
 Yeah it's really uh really a good point .
 I hope the students of management die , but anyway .
 Now who are recording this meeting ?
 I think it
**********
 So
 One second .
 So we have to take some decision on this aspect . So , uh so for
 sorry , for uh component , so
 So
 we have to think about those aspects , sorry .
 So we will just use a a standard battery ?
 Yeah .
 And uh the chip we chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use . Uh what do you mean by case ?
 I think it's the box that should be spongy , banana's shape .
 Yeah .
 Uh I mean for me if we use a a spongy banana case , doesn't matter . I just want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box , and that's it .
 The only th
 Yeah .
 Y Yeah that can be in inside th in the structure . But uh the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be I mean if it's spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to I mean if it's spongy then it's going to move , right ? So , it's going to be bend a lot .
 Yeah yeah . Yeah .
 Spongy also .
 So if we try to push the buttons , it You think it's possible ?
 Oh no I think it's possible .
 But
 No the button would be In fact it it should be something odd shaped , with a spongy cover .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 Yeah . This is uh like the
 Yeah .
 Okay odd shape with spongy
 cover . And standard battery okay , a chip imprint , there's no specific problem . So we agree to put the wheel
 Mm-hmm .
 Wheel on the top . Button , where do we want some buttons ?
 Well , usually hold 'Kay , we want it to be good also for the left-hand users , right ?
 Yeah .
 Uh
 So it have to it has to be symmetrical .
 Yeah but okay . Sa let's say that th o It has to be basically you can only take two sides , one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is uh yeah also the thumb . Basically . Or you could use use this one , but I don't know if it's very comfortable , to use this one for the wheel .
 Yep . Yep .
 Yeah maybe the thumb is more comfortable .
 This for the wheel and then this for the buttons ? Should have the two sides .
 Yeah I think it's okay for both right and left . Mm .
 Mm-hmm .
 So if the left , we have
 the op
 I think you can turn it this way also .
 You can do both with both hands .
 Wheel Wheel buttons . Yeah , the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around , the buttons are on the other side .
 I think it's okay .
 So you cannot see them .
 Well , you you will get used to it . And moreover , th the button ar are lighted so you you immediately identify the right side , because you have light on buttons .
 Yeah .
 So the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be
 Y
 Yeah I know , but uh if you hold with your left hand , and the wheel is here , and the buttons are here , then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side .
 Yeah .
 No you you I think you will use it only on the right or left hand , whether you are righty or lefty .
 I think for lefty it's okay . I can do this movement , and for righty as well .
 I think this doesn't change that much .
 Okay .
 Yeah ?
 Okay . Maybe .
 Yeah .
 So , for interface we said also that we have uh this banana shape with button on the s on the side .
 And
 and uh a wheel on the top .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 So the colour is yellow .
 I think it's uh we defined everything according to
 what we should what the decision we should take , yeah .
**********
 So maybe we can um
 we can uh work on those aspects uh until next meeting . So have the final uh look and feel design according to the decision .
 And have the the user interface design and uh then evaluate the prodyuc the product .
 That is to say , uh check if it fit the the requirement uh given by the users , but according to uh your presentation it seems to be okay . It seems to be fancy , innovative , and easy to use .
 Mm-hmm .
 So
 so
 to prepare the prototype I would suggest that the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer uh work together . That would uh
 Yeah .
 be better , I think .
 And uh
 And so uh
 you will receive further instruction by emails , as usual .
 Mm-hmm . Yes master .
 So do you need to add anything ?
 No .
 You feel okay ?
 Yeah .
 You feel uh free to express what you want to say ? You don't feel too constrained ?
 Yeah .
 You don't feel free to answer this ?
 No .
 Maybe you can make uh uh mm okay .
 Okay , so
 Thank you .
 See you .
