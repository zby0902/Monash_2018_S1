 Great man . Who starts ?
 Well I'll uh start just with another presentation , so then we can uh look at th at the agenda uh for this meeting .
 Alright , great .
 Alright .
 Okay .
 I've put some uh new things in the in the map .
 Mm-hmm .
 Uh oh .
 This is it .
 I don't know the shortcut , so Ah F_ five . Well our functional design meeting , that's the stage we're in . And you also ha all three of you have uh prepared something about it .
 Mm .
 Yes .
 Well um in we'll uh just have a look at the at the notes from the previous meeting , what we uh thought we had dec decided . But uh
 Uh then we'll uh look at uh the three uh presentations uh from you .
 'Kay .
 I think you have prepared uh all three uh ? Um we'll look at th the new project requirements we uh I dunno . Y you also have uh received that mail , the new project requirements from our bosses ?
 Well , yeah .
 Yeah .
 No .
 No . You're the only one .
 Oh I've received a mail with uh some additional requirements , and I'll have a look if Well I think we should show them before your presentations , because it's not really uh
 Oh .
 Alright .
 smart uh to uh to include some things uh we can't , because of the new requirements . Well um then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions . We have to deb we have to decide it in this meeting what our function will be .
 'Kay .
 And then uh we can discuss uh some more closely . Uh
 We have forty minutes for this uh discussion ?
 Uh yeah , I think so . Well uh the closing uh we'll not uh look at it yet .
 Alright .
 Alright .
 Um now I'll look at show this board .
 Um
 Well uh notes , first meeting .
 Now .
 I gave a disc a a presentation . Uh we familiarised ourself with the boards and then we discussed some first ideas . So
 we said that uh
 we have to merge the strong points from our uh competitors , and uh look at their uh remote controls . We should make it uh compatible with our new D_V_D_ and other releases we have , our technical releases . Uh not too many one buttons . One recognisable button in the middle , where you do the most important functions with . And um well they can have two functions , because uh you have a D_V_D_ and a television .
 Right .
 Huh ?
 Yeah .
 Um the design has to fit the hand , be original , but also be familiar .
 It's uh one of our ideas . Yeah well that wa It's just thirty minutes ago , so it's not quite uh But well I have to do it . The materials uh well should be hard plastic with rubber from , and uh well the labelling of the buttons should be indestructible .
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm , now it's right .
 It should be uh recognisable at all times . Yes . Well fronts were to be just like mobile telephones .
 It's meant to be easily wiped out , yeah .
 Mm .
 Okay .
 And uh the technical aspects um And also labelling of the buttons , the functions should be universal standards . Well that's just uh some ideas from the first meeting . It's quite logical al all of it .
 Mm-hmm .
**********
 Um now the new project requirements , I'll just show them . I got this mail
 from uh our bosses . Well , teletext goes out . We will not use teletext .
 Oh .
 Okay .
 Maybe a new sort of thing , but n but not teletext . Well
 I I disagree , but uh it's not uh t it's not my place to disagree I guess .
 the second is a bit
 sh pity because we just said we wanted to d include the D_V_D_ and they don't want it , because of our time we have for this project .
 Oh .
 Alright .
 Oh , alright .
 Oh , that's a shame .
 So that's a shame , because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years .
 Because uh we don't have those customers a lot at th at this point . Um well it's a bit pity because it's just those people want to have uh one remote control for all those technical devices they can uh reach it .
 Yeah .
 But let's forget about it . It's just time-consuming , so we uh have to go on .
 Yeah .
 Well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products . So uh we have to uh use uh maybe a slogan , maybe a colour , and um Yeah well uh on our remote controls the design has to be uh , well as we already said a actually , uh familiar . Uh not only just uh the shape but also our company .
 Yes .
 Yeah , we are a real fashionable company . I read uh I read it on the I didn't know what company we were , but we we design uh especially trendy uh trendy trendy stuff . So it has to be uh a modern design . That's important to know , uh when you design a thing of course .
 Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Mm .
 Okay .
 Yes . I I uh noted uh our uh slogan that we have , our company . It's uh we mm put the fashion in electronics .
 Yeah .
 Right .
 Yeah .
 So maybe that's a slogan we can put uh somewhere on our remote control or something .
**********
 Alright then um we're going to uh have three presentations . You want to start ? Oh you have to start ? I didn't see anything about uh who had to start . Well s then start .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . I think I have to start . Oh no , no problem . I I just have to uh to think which file's mine , 'cause I was uh bit in a hurry .
 The order ? No .
 Mm .
 Okay . Well uh
 I think it's this one .
 But I'm not sure .
 You already uh opened uh PowerPoint .
 Hmm ? Yeah . S
 Right .
 Yeah .
 Yes . This is it .
**********
 Well , I'm going to tell you something about functional requirements . Um to start with these points . Uh next sheet ?
 Mm-hmm .
 Um at first I tell you something about what people dislike about the current uh controls , because it's uh a smart thing to exclude those things . Uh , furthermore it's very important what they do like and what they do use .
 Um then I tell something about um the most important issues . So we have to focus on those three thing three things . And in the end I'll um show you our target audience or our target product users , customers .
 Well , um the first findings are that people um
 think most controls are very kind of ug ugly .
 That's seventy five per cent of the current users . They don't like it , so we might think about fronts in that section . Um
 They also say , that's about uh I thought it was fifty per cent , uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls . So it's very important that you design a a nice looking control .
 Um the current user uses his machine just about
 well all of the time for a few functions . Uh , almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity . So it's really important to make the the buttons for the common uh tasks kind of big or kind of uh flashy .
 Furthermore , it's uh seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot . Thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle , so you can reach it with your thumb . Yeah , yeah right .
 You can zap away . Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Right .
 I think our uh user uh expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote , of course . Uh
 Yeah but people don't read manuals .
 I didn't read it ? Oh , alright . users to uh add one ? Do you think ?
 No .
 No .
 I don't think
 I think you should put more time in the in the design of uh pick up and use , than a manual .
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm . Yeah alright . Because they don't use it ? Alright .
 Yes you should You should could take a look at it and and and know how it how it's supposed to work .
 A lot of losers um users lose their controls in their in their living room . So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television , that's your um your control beeps or something , that you can find this very easily . I dunno , maybe that's an idea . 'Cause it's uh a big I think fifty per cent of the users loses his its control , within the same room . So
 Yeah .
 Well
 Oh .
 Oh ?
 Yeah .
 It should actually uh It should actually be loose from the television , because it can also be used for other televisions . So if you deliver a small uh click-on device that you can put on your television , that bleeps to your remote control , everyone can use it . No you can click it on your television .
 Yeah but what if you lose your click-on device ?
 Yeah but if someone d somebody else uses it in ano other room or something ?
 Yeah in another room , yeah . Well yes .
 Nee but it it specifically says it's uh the the control is lost in the same room .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 So
 Well a beeping device would be Uh furthermore the learning time is a problem . Uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it's it's too uh too difficult to learn . So the the learning curve should be very short uh for the dumbest people should be able to use it .
 Well we'll have a look at it , yeah .
 Yep .
 Yeah . Right .
 Well there sh should always be a menu , but it c can be very short .
 And it should be consistent with consistent with older remotes .
 Yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control , I think .
 Yes okay .
 Well maybe for the If you don't recognise a button who d who d who do I call uh wh when I don't know it ?
 Alright .
 Yeah right . It sh it should be there , the manual . But but not to explain how the remote works . Only
 And we don't have much time . So it's better to uh put our attention to the the design . So you can pick up and use it , than I think .
 Well we are a design team , we can say to some uh writer uh make a manual point .
 Hmm .
 Yeah right , right .
 Isn't it part of the of the u No . No . Never mind .
 So
 Well we'll have a look . Um yes ?
 Next point . Um R_S_I_ . Well that's about twenty per cent I thought . But uh the designer should uh take it uh should uh Wie zeg ik dat ? Yeah , consider the consequences of using your remote . It should be a good in your hand .
 Consider the m
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yep .
 Right , this is the most important part .
 Alright . Um , I think that's it . Um
 Um , we're Like the requirements said , we're gonna specify of we're gonna target a younger audience . Um , that's about sixty per cent of the market , so it's uh quite important . Um research shows that they like to have a little L_C_D_ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device . Uh
 I thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty , ninety nine per cent of uh the people like that . So it's very important we should definitely have that in our uh designs .
 Well
 Well with twelve Euro fifty as production cost , we can't uh afford an L_C_D_ uh
 It's going to be expensive . Yeah .
 No .
 Yeah but they think it's really important . So if we want to s If we have a big
 Yeah .
 If we make lots of uh of the stuff , maybe we can uh buy it very cheap , I dunno . We have to uh
 Well we'll uh consider it uh .
 Well Yeah well uh it's your your task to uh look into the costs uh of those uh Nigh I know .
 We'll think abo we'll think
 Yeah , I don't know . I don't have any information on that . So
 No , we'll look we'll look into that later . Alright ?
 Right . And uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition . They also like that , but research is very uh costly . So
 I think that's uh difficult to realise also .
 Yeah , but
 it it might be important for the sale .
 We have very demanding clients .
 It's not yet a standard uh development uh those so
 No and we have customers in multiple uh countries I think .
 Well I do think L_C_D_ is more reachable than the speech recognition . So we might consider L_C_D_ screens .
 We sh
 Yeah absolutely .
 Yeah .
 No .
 Yeah , yeah , alright . Well we'll consider both and and see what uh what what we can find , I think . We don't rule them out uh yet .
 Alright .
 Yep .
 'Kay .
 Alright .
 I think
 it is sensible
 to u uh to take this take these points into the notes . So you can Right .
 Yes .
 Well you I c I can uh still see your presentation .
 Yeah . Right .
 It's in the
**********
 Well uh next um I dunno who is next . You uh got uh
 Shall I give a technical talk ? Alright .
 Oh you go .
 Yes . Well go ahead .
 Well uh it is my task to uh explain uh or to point out a working design .
 Yip .
 We have that here . Okay , how do you enlarge it , so that you can have the F_ F_ five .
 F_ five .
 F_ five .
 Yep . Well , the working design , that's my uh
 Alright . Next button .
 Well alright uh , you know who I am and what I do . So uh we have this . It's a bit uh unclear because I wanted to copy paste something . It was originally in black and white but it became black and purple . But I think you can read it . Um well um I think it's important uh for you to realise the basic function of a remote control . Uh well you can see uh
 Oh right .
 Purple .
 Yeah , yeah , yeah . A bit .
 Maybe you can select it . So it uh inverts .
 And I then can select I can select on the dings It goes to the next page .
 the p the whole picture . Nah , uh never mind .
 Click .
 Well , you can read it , it's not too difficult .
 Meanwhile , this is a schematic uh um view of uh how a basic remote control works . You have uh basically uh the energy , the power of the of the remote control , uh and the sender , w which is the LED , the the the the the the the the the bulb that sends the the infrared beam to the , no , to the set .
 Yeah , go ahead .
 Yeah .
 Alright .
 And uh the source is of course the user . Uh the user interface is um uh the the the buttons of course . And the the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip , and the chip uh sends it to the LED , and the LED sends it to the receiver . That's the that's the basic idea . Very basic .
 Yep .
 Um well I have uh uh put it in a in in in a a couple of basic steps . Uh the remote uh is basically just waiting for a user to press a key . It does nothing until uh of course uh the key is pressed .
 The key a signal to a chip , uh the chip senses the connection . uh and recognise the key . So well you understand . The chip uh produces Morse code , um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , of course . And it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send uh that signal again to the to the LED , which is the bulb , of course .
 Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the , well it's uh very simple , and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the T_V_ set , and the T_V_ set uh also recognises the the the signal , and performs the assigned task .
 Yeah .
 So it is also why we have to have a button that says uh I'm now busy with a D_V_D_ uh if we had done that . And a button for T_V_ . So
 Ah bu Yeah , but we don't . Uh we No no , but Yeah . Exactly . Uh well this is uh the basic uh function of a remote . I've some couple of pictures here . It's a very basic one . And uh if we if we're going to add an uh an uh L_C_D_ screen to it , it uh won't look anything like this , but
 This is very basic uh basically the the shape of um of a remote control .
 It has uh very little buttons and But it it uh it's it's quite um Yeah , you can easily recognise the buttons . They're uh far enough apart and an anything . It's not very um
 High tech .
 uh not very high-tech uh indeed , and it's not very user-friendly . Uh if you look at the shape , it's uh just a simple long box uh shape . So we have to uh change a little bit uh to that , uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly , and that uh problems like uh R_S_I_ and uh those kinds of thing don't don't oc don't occur . Yeah .
 Right .
 Can I say something ? Um I have a table here about uh the l the relevance of the buttons . Uh the power button is used very much , channel selection , volume and teletext . Well teletext is not an option , so that uh But I think it's very important to make um the power , channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb , so you can't have R_S_I_ uh consequences .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah , because they are the the most important buttons and you can immediately
 Right . Make them big , make them easy to uh to press .
 Well but but if you have um the most used buttons all in one place , and you keep making the same um well moves . But if y if you would put it at a different place , then you have to move your hands , and that's on of the things about R_S_I_ .
 You don't have to look and and search for them .
 You can also like
 Right .
 Yeah , right . Right .
 Yeah , I was thinking you can
 Yeah , that's right . That's right . That's right . We
 Are some of the the the um
 Well you you can't have any uh every button under the thumb , of course .
 No but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would
 But
 Yeah . That's very important . And
 reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_ .
 Maybe you can make , for for channel changing , two little buttons on the side of the remote , so you can just do like this . Like some uh little uh Gameboy things or some Hmm ?
 Yes I've saw that on m on mi mobile telephones they also have uh those buttons .
 But is that is that useable ? Do people , uh when they pick up a remote , know that they have to do that ?
 It's a f it's a new feature , you can make make a double feature l like a button on the top and under it .
 Well
 Well it it's
 Yeah .
 Yeah alright , but
 Yeah , but if you s say them up and down , they they'll understand it , I think . Eighty per cent would .
 Well also i if someone puts picks up his uh remote
 Yeah . If someone puts up i uh picks up his remote , and he picks up it he he touches the side then he's a already on the next channel . That's very irritating , I think . Well . No .
 Well , .
 Yeah , he feels it immediately . Yeah , that's right . Yeah .
 Yeah that's true .
 Yeah but
 Right , continue . Sorry .
 But in e in any case the the basic function should be uh indeed , and as you say at the thumb . I think that's a good idea , and uh and that the less important uh buttons , like the the the different channels , uh the numbers one two three four five as well , should be uh yeah well not in reach , because uh they don't use it uh all the time .
 Well it's uh pretty pretty basically uh as you said .
 And I have some pictures of the inside workings , but uh I don't want to get too technical , because uh that's not uh very uh useful for you .
 Yep .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah , that's right .
 That's your part of the job .
 So yeah exactly this is uh how it uh looks from the inside . And uh well that's about it I think . Oh yeah , I still have this . Oh I had to delete this , but I had to make a schematic uh of the of the new But I had too too little time , but uh don't uh
 Yep .
 Alright .
 Okay . Well we understand . We understand . Oh right , no .
 don't look at it please . I I think it's it's clear uh how it works . Alright . That's the most important thing .
 Alright .
 Yeah , it's clear .
 Nice .
 Alright . Uh
**********
 Then uh Mike can uh give the third presentation .
 How late is did we start his presentation uh ?
 Right .
 I dunno . I think uh w
 About twenty minutes ago ?
 Wha Yeah .
 Losing time losing time .
 Well then we have still the time , so But we do have to come to a decision , right later on .
 Yeah right . So
 So
 Mm .
 Well I thought um everybody on the website uh would see the same thing , but
 I don't think so .
 obviously that's not the case .
 Yeah , uh there are different uh We have all have different home pages , with different links . Yeah .
 Oh yeah ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah right .
 Uh ?
 For instance you couldn't see this .
 Okay , yeah well .
 Um
 Yeah . Well I'm Mike , User Interface Designer .
 Mm-hmm .
 The the method ? Well
 I used my own experience with remotes , took a good l look uh at the remotes on the corporate website , which are these two . Um
 Yeah .
 These are already in use ?
 Yes , these are from from another uh manufacturer . Um
 Alright , okay .
 This one is engineering-centred , so this one has the most functions and um things .
 This one is user-centred .
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Um
 Well Yeah , me too .
 I like user-centred . Yeah .
 I like user-centr centred uh uh also the best .
 We also do that .
 Um
 Well , I thought uh that we uh reduce the the option to control the D_V_D_ also , and teletext and that kind of stuff .
 Mm .
 Uh so I thought we we we would use more or need more buttons than this one . But
 But we have to reject that , because of the requirements ?
 Yes . Th that's why this mm is not relevant any more I feel . Um
 Yeah .
 Alright .
 I think this is about the maximum number of buttons uh we'll need .
 I um I kinda like the shape . I think this is what we talked about . But
 Yeah , right .
 Yeah .
 You can't really see uh the differ from different sides . But I think uh
 No I've Well I showed it somewhere . Um
 Uh you can draw it if you Yeah .
 Oh yeah . I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front . So we can can uh yeah customise the
 Mm-hmm .
 Well absolutely , but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company . So we cannot just uh
 Mm ?
 Yeah . It's a front . It's not the the whole remote that changes , of course . You can
 make someone w
 No but that's th the side they look uh look at is the front . So if y if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it , then uh our recognition is totally gone .
 But it
 Mm .
 Yeah , that's right .
 Or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote . So l like Ericsson does every uh
 Yeah , that's a must . We must have that .
 Yeah , we must . Yeah well and and
 We can put it on the on the back side .
 S something like this . It's recognisable .
 Yes .
 'Kay .
 We can make a symbol of the company right here . And if you put a front on it , there's a hole on the front . So the symbol's always on Yeah .
 Um
 Yeah ?
 Yeah , so that you don't replace the symbol , yeah .
 Yeah yeah . Something like that , in the Yeah .
 Yeah yeah yeah . Or the th the the lowest part of the remote isn't changed by the front . Those kind of things . Yes . Okay .
 Yeah , yeah . But let's not focus on the front .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 Um Well so uh uh like I said I thought we'd we'd use more function . If we we had to include more functions . But we don't . So um
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah . I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we need . Maybe some less . Like eject we don't need , and some other buttons we don't need . I think uh
 Alright .
 Mike , uh can you put uh that picture from me on the in the Word documents file ? In Map ?
 Yeah , I will . I think uh for the remote um uh less is more . The less buttons the better the design . Um
 Yeah .
 Yeah , I agree .
 We should go with that concept I think .
 I know .
 Alright .
**********
 I've I've got another point . Um there are two target audi audiences , and we've uh chose for the younger one . Um , research has shown that um it's a high interested uh in features . They are high high interested in feature . But they are more critical . Fo Yeah , critical . So The younger audience . So we must um must design uh a control that really speaks to the people .
 Yeah ?
 Mm .
 The younger uh
 Mm-hmm .
 Uh we uh we were busy with that . Uh yeah we should uh summon the the different uh aspects of the thing . So , we have the power button .
 Yeah .
 Well what if we um I at I at home have a remote that has um the most familiar uh buttons on the top , and the bottom side of the front has a little clip , a f a little uh You can click away and then you have f much more functions that most people don't use but s some do do .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm . I think uh the most functions uh underneath that uh uh No um mm usually
 Clip aren't used much .
 Well but because you say they their features are important , they want m um a lot , but not
 Yeah right .
 But
 Yeah , but what kind of features ? Like L_C_D_ screens and voice recognition . But I've
 Yeah I think m most
 Yeah but Yeah .
 Most uh
 Here , look at these numbers . The newest features are , like I said , are uh L_C_D_ and uh speech uh control .
 Our audience , these people , are very like these uh features . You see ? So we must build in something , or they will to uh go to the concurrent . The concurrent ? Competitors , right . So , I do think we have to uh have some features .
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm . Uh .
 Competitors .
 Yeah . Our competitor . Yeah .
 Yeah . Well maybe w we could uh s On um some uh calculators you have lo those little little L_C_D_ th that you can click on or something , or that you can click uh out uh of the remote . And if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information . Yeah .
 Even though they cost a little more .
 Right . Right .
 Like a ticker-tape . Which programme you are l watching or something .
 Yeah , that's nice .
 Those kind of things , uh because you also have those uh those program recognition for your V_ V_C_R_s .
 And uh well if y if your remote picks that up also , you they can display which programme you're currently watching .
 Yeah , right . Yeah right .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . So it it just signals the the different uh sig uh the different symbols on the screen you have , uh because if you change to s channel two you have two on the screen and two on your on your um on your L_C_D_ screen .
 Yeah .
 For example .
 It it could be such a little uh th that you can click in and out and you and you have it .
 Yeah , we should keep that simple too . It will
 But should it uh really be uh clickable , uh or or just integrate inside to try to make it d more trendy .
 Yeah .
 No not clickable . Nah , no no no . Yeah , just at at the top . So when you s you sit like this you can can watch . I think it should be at the top .
 Well maybe .
 No , it should be uh integrated . I think
 Yeah . Yeah .
 Yeah , something like on um some radios in car . You Where it's , yeah , walking to Yeah .
 Yeah right . It's a ticker-tape idea .
 R_D_S_s or something .
 But that's of course uh a bit more uh expensive than uh the basic uh calculator design , with the scrolling text and that kind of thing .
 Wa Yeah .
 Well it's just one script .
 Well I think it's you got It just means it's a script that's uh keeps it uh rolling , and it's not uh That's five minutes off uh implementing time I think uh
 Yeah , five minutes of ja ja for programming . So I don't think that's the issue .
 Yeah .
 No .
 Alright .
 Alright , we go with the L_C_D_ screen ?
 Uh well I think so , yes . Um
 Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost .
 'Kay .
 Right , I don't know if I can find that , but
 We're g No but we're we'll have to look into that .
 Or maybe you will get that information uh Yeah .
 Next time . Yeah right .
 Um we can use this board again , I think . Uh we can put some um decisions about um the controls we want , th the issue . Where is my presentation ? Uh
 Yeah , I understand what you're saying .
 Uh
 Well but uh what what if we we first decide the different functions , and then look at the design . Because we have to decide this .
 We should have a general idea of how it's gonna look .
 Well
 I mean we're all here now , I think . These I've already given you . So we have to decide on the different remote control functions .
 Right .
 So we want to have a small L_C_D_ screen that's special .
 At the top .
 Shouldn't we start with the most important parts ? The L_C_D_ screen alright but we should start with the power button ? Uh
 At the top or at the bottom ?
 Yes .
 I think the top is more uh
 Yeah .
 When you s How do you zap ? You just sit in your chair ?
 Yeah but
 Huh ?
 With the remote ?
 Yeah but with with the L_C_D_ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural . 'Cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom .
 That thing is terrible .
 Yeah but that's where your hand ball might be . Yeah , I dunno .
 Uh
 Yeah , no Mm .
 And then uh
 We'll draw two , and then we'll see uh
 Maybe we should uh centralise the discussion here . I dunno what uh you were talking about but
 No Um he thinks Yeah , right . He thinks it's better to put the L_C_D_ at the bottom , and I think it's better at the top .
 we are busy with something .
 Uh-huh . Why do you think it's better at the bottom ?
 Well
 Uh well because most uh remotes have um some space left at the bottom , and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody . I c
 But your
 But you just can put uh the the the the the whole interface a bit down , so that there's room for the for the interface .
 Yeah . The the ticker The L_C_D_ is like like small . It's it's wide . It's not not high . But
 Well I d I think that's that's ugly but
 Uh-huh .
 I th
 Well I th I think Mike Mike has a point , because um when when uh when I use a remote I l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom . So and and I I like to use the ones
 And and we can
 Yeah . Power button always Yeah .
 Bottom .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , y you gotta zap like this or you want to Yeah .
 on the top . So when I u when I have to have an L_C_D_ s scr window
 Yeah right . But
 Well that's a bit exaggerated . Well , I agree with you .
 We're making a remote with with a few functions you know . We
 It's it's also more recognisable . It looks more like a calculator to people , if you have the l the the
 Yes but we we we we don't want that . We don't want them to look like a calculator . We want to look it like our original but familiar
 the thing on top .
 Yeah you don't want You want uh Yeah it it it must be a remote .
 Yeah w well , but uh you don't have to throw uh um important aspe important aspect like familiarity uh completely away , uh because I think it's uh
 Yeah .
 High-tech .
 Yea
 Maybe a bic uh better uh white uh We White ?
 I think it's still important to have it at the top , because it's uh
 Width .
 Width . Uh format yeah format ? Line width ? Width ?
 Th that's not a problem . When I draw here it Oh . Huh ?
 it's more familiar that way .
 Yeah ?
 It's a bit off . Well .
 Yeah , it's off .
 A little a little bit .
 It it needs to be calibrated again . Well
 Well uh let's uh talk about that later uh
 Maybe you should another pen . Maybe that's uh better .
 You e you only have one pen for that screen . Yeah .
 Where ?
 Alright , we have to make a decision now , because we don't have much time . Um
 It's special pen .
 Yeah . No .
 I think we have uh a few functions , and we can put uh the L_C_D_ above it , and still have lots of room at the bottom , where you can put your hand .
 Yeah . I I agree .
 I think it should be at the button , bottom .
 Well I'm the I I'm the designer , so um
 At the bottom ? In a few minutes Oh yeah , oh yeah , I totally agree . Yeah .
 Bottom . The L_C_D_ .
 At the bot
 Yeah .
 So
 We are two uh V_S_ two .
 He's the boss .
 Yeah .
 Right . Great .
 And moreover I think that you two should be uh come to consensus about the L_C_D_ s . It's uh your it's your job .
 Yes .
 Yeah of course . Uh it's uh . Yeah . W wh
 Well we have a power button . Guys ?
 No it's our job . For all of us I think .
 While you have to agree , I can say it's like this and you must agree . Yeah .
 Yeah , right .
 Guys ? We have a power button , setting buttons , L_C_D_ window , the number buttons
 Alright , let's keep it central .
 The ten numbers ? Yeah ?
 Channel , yeah .
 Uh
 Volume ?
 Volume control .
 Yes .
 Um
 Mm .
 Uh the mute button . I h love that one .
 Well let's look at your uh design . Uh
 Uh-huh .
 I think we we should use something like this um to um
 The the channel up and channel down button ? Yeah , in circle , you know ?
 Yes .
 Yeah . Yeah yeah yeah . Well that's that's also design .
 And and a volume control also in it .
 Yes .
 Right .
 Um
 Yeah . But th th on this remote th these controls are for something else , a D_V_D_ player or something . So
 Well h ho
 Yes . Yes . They are for some uh video uh
 Yes , as I already said , we could drop some of these buttons .
 You should put that uh power button , channel and volume should have the most uh importance .
 Yeah .
 Yes . Oh man , five minutes .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , well five minutes left . Yep .
 I think these should be in one big circle in the middle .
 Yeah , but what he said about R_S_I_
 was t kinda true . When when you uh put them all in the same place , the most used buttons , you're doing the same thing all the time , and that's just what R_S_I_'s all about . So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other .
 Apart .
 So people have to move their hand . And they get less uh complaints of R_S_I_ .
 Yeah , it's it's also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one hand . Y Yeah . It's good to move uh from time to time . Yeah .
 That's what I always do , because all my i important buttons are the same place .
 Yeah but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place . They they need to be centred .
 Um
 Yes ?
 No but now y W would we have to choose a
 Well not
 Frequency of uh button use . Um channels are uh most uh is most used within the hour . You can see . So the the channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart , I think , up and down .
 way in middle ?
 Yes .
 Volume hardly .
 Uh-huh .
 Mm-hmm .
 No I don't think .
 Oh . Far apart ?
 Up and down far apart from each other ?
 You thinking uh about R_S_I_ ?
 Yeah but
 Yeah but No .
 Well not too much .
 Y look at uh look at the frequency . Nei not too much , but
 The other the other two uh frustrations are far more important . So
 I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together , but you don't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together .
 Well for example the power button , you can If someone is constantly z zapping , it's not going to miss , that it that the power button is not right beside it . Because I have someone But the buttons is way . So that one can be put away .
 Well they are used four times an hour , so
 Nei nei nei n I I totally agree . But just
 Yeah . Right .
 Yeah . I agree .
 The power button can uh be uh uh
 Power bu button should be left at the top .
 And should and should be red .
 Right , just make some decisions .
 The most important things we have to uh
 Um how are we going to do it with those numbers ?
 C c can you make you make We can use uh the drawing board now , I think . Uh it it doesn't work well but But it it would be pretty pretty uh nice if we could just draw a simple thing .
 Well I have it here .
 I do think you have to keep you have to keep it central now . Just uh you decide that , you decide that , and ready .
 Yeah well that's going to take too too much time . Yes .
 Mm . Yeah .
 Mm . Alright .
 Yes .
 Well the L_C_D_ . Um you are Industrial , you are User Interface . So I think it's going to go to Mike . But you will have to make consensus with . Well
 Yeah .
 Well consensus , um We we can put it in the middle , so
 Well it's a bit hard , because we are going to be uh individually . That's a bit uh
 Nei . We're No We're deciding now , so
 Yes .
 Top or bottom ?
 Well uh yeah I I still think it's it's quite important though to uh to have it at the top , so Yeah . You say familiarity isn't important but
 Yes it is .
 Well what if we're going to now decide about the functions , and the design comes into the next round ?
 Okay .
 Plus the d th the design round is still to come huh ?
 Yeah d
 Yeah , right . Okay .
 Yeah .
 Alright .
 Alright these functions . The number f Well yes , that's alright . W the number function . Are we going to uh do it like uh on Mike's screen with uh one button that says I'm going to do a t two number digital ?
 As we we we we agreed , we do have a L_C_D_ . So that's
 Yeah , okay .
 that's enough . Yeah .
 No .
 How do you want it to do then ?
 There's one two three four five six six seven eight nine zero .
 Well just when you push a one one and
 It it has to r recognise one as there could still come more .
 No , if you On most T_V_s if you uh press two numbers shortly after each other , d it Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
 Oh , like that . Um
 Yes .
 They'd recognise it . Th that's the most That that's very easy . Yeah .
 Alright so no button for that .
 No .
 Okay uh anyone any uh oth other functionalities of our uh remote ?
 I think these are the the most important functions .
 Do you still have the pictures over there ?
 Yeah .
 So
 Yeah , that's about it .
 You do need the uh multi Or did uh No , like this one . You do need them ? Yeah , I know . But are we
 No , we'd uh just said we didn't uh
 Alright , alright uh Now okay .
 Well uh
 Um well because we can't integrate it with any other uh remotes , all those buttons on those pictures are uh irrelevant . So just for a television is that all we need ?
 Right .
 Yeah , it's most useable this way .
 basic function .
 Yeah .
 Teletext is gone . So all those buttons that ar are to do with teletext Oh screen placing .
 We'll have uh those uh buttons about uh
 And uh the two important ones we're l f forgetting . Uh there's um screen . You can make it wider and less wide . And the button that you can go to A_V_ for your video .
 Yeah .
 Right . I do think we have to put that underneath a clip .
 Oh yeah .
 Those two ? But it's just two , and we make a clip ?
 Uh just two just two under uh under uh
 Th that's a bit uh waste .
 We we can make make uh a little row of like four buttons down here .
 Yes .
 Yeah . Okay , right .
 I I think uh
 Or at the top . Your L_C_D_ screen is going to go .
 Or at Yeah alright then .
 But you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section . Uh that's that's too complicated . You can just put it somewhere They they aren't used much , not as much as those other , so you can put it somewhere
 Yes .
 Yeah
 Oh , they can be small or round like buttons .
 Yeah s bit smaller and s Well uh and and I think more at the bottom . Yeah .
 Yeah or at the top , yeah . What do you think uh those those buttons ? Above or down ?
 Well I think they should in an in an isolated part of the remote .
 And w where ? Well we design it later . We have it , and we design later where everything goes . Yeah .
 Yes ? Yes . Yes . Well any other uh
 Well if you you take those th If you
 Why go to video ?
 Go to video , that's always on your remote control . To A_V_ uh to A_V_ A_V_ A_V_ .
 Yeah , but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh
 The the video channel uh ?
 That's just zero . Yeah .
 Well l n no not at not at my remote .
 No no not always . Ze yeah zero is a different channel than uh the the video channel .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , but you can can zap down
 Yeah , but when you zap down zero you get to A_V_ .
 Yes .
 Yes , I think th
 I don't . I go to ninety-nine .
 No , then you press ninety nine . I think go to video is
 Ah uh well whatever , .
 an irrelevant button , but
 Th that's the button uh No .
 But it's easy to go If you are at uh at channel uh fifty five and you want to uh go immediately to the video channel , you do you have to push a to to get below zero . It's more easy to get to uh where the specific uh video channel button .
 No you can ch push zero . Yeah . Yeah , I I think that one button is uh I use it uh
 Yeah , but if we're choosing to uh incorporate these buttons , you have to have uh channel setting , if you wa if you have a new T_V_ . You have to set the channels . Right all th these uh different buttons you have to
 Yeah ?
 These buttons , I don't have buttons for channel setting uh especially on my remote .
 Ah , I do .
 Yeah well uh d different screen settings a Yeah , sk Yeah y you you you you have screen width .
 It's it's incorporated with p m plus and down , uh those
 Yeah well y you must have .
 Yeah you yeah you have one one button from s set frequency o or something , and then with plus and min minus you can uh adjust the uh
 Right . That's the only one we put uh in there .
 So we still have one uh four ?
 For a screen uh fu uh channel setting .
 Ch ch
 Yeah to uh oh yeah of course to configure the programme the Yeah .
 Programme , right .
 Okay . Oh the Okay button ? Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button , for your menu . Menu button .
 Uh
 Yeah .
 Yeah , alright .
 You should Yeah . I think that's important . Uh And and the settings to change the brightness the settings to change the brightness and the contrast .
 Channel , setting , menu . We have to go .
 Okay .
 Channel , yeah .
 So um Save .
 Chief ?
 Chief ?
 Yes see .
 Th the menu menu button is also important . Then you can uh
 Yes I have put it in .
 Where ? I don't see it . Oh Menu , alright .
 Here .
 I think things like uh contrast and brightness should be um in the menu , yeah .
 In the menu . And you can uh then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something . Because uh the zapping buttons aren't used then if you are in the menu . Yeah . Or the volume , yeah .
 Yeah , the
 Alright .
 Or the volume or something like that .
