    "Getting a specific piece of text from a large block of text is a very challenging problem in parsing data.\n",
    "In various programming languages there are built-in string functions available for \n",
    "searching and replacing. For example, the [common string operations](https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html) built in Python. \n",
    "However, these methods are limited to simplest cases. For example, the `string.find()` method in Python \n",
    "returns the lowest index of the matched substring in a given string.\n",
    "In more complex cases, such as data validation, where you are going to test an string to see if a telephone number pattern occurs within the string, it could result in code containing a stack of \n",
    "`if` statements by using different Python's built-in string functions.\n",
    "To simplify the code and make it more readable, you might need to move up to [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression). So what is a regular expression?\n",

    "\n",
    "If you've ever typed `cp *.ipynb ../module_2/` at the UNIX command prompt, or entered \"match?\" into a web-based search engine, you've already used a simple regular expression. In the first instance, you've copied all the files which end with file extension \".ipynb\" (as opposed to copying them one by one); in the second, you've conducted a search not only for \"match,\" but also for \"matches\", \"matching\", \"matched\", and \"matcher\" all at once.\n",
    "Using a well-crafted regular expression, you can easily search through a large number of text files, searching for words ending with \"ed\", replace the .html suffix with a .xml suffix, and then change all the lower case characters to upper case. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions (Regex) are all about matching and finding patterns in text, from simple patterns to the very complex ones.\n",
    "For instance, they can be simple as this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    \\d\n",
    "```\n",
    "A character shorthand that matches any digit from 0 to 9.\n",
    "They can also be something a bit more complicated like \n",
    "```python\n",
    "(19|20)\\d\\d[- /.](0[1-9]|1[012])[- /.](0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])\n",
    "```\n",
    "which is where we will wind up at the end of this chapter: a fairly robust regular expression\n",
    "that matches a date in yyyy-mm-dd format from between 1900-01-01 and 2099-12-31, with a choice of four separators, which are '-', ' ', '/' and '.'. This regular expression can be visualised as\n",

    "## 1. Get Started with Regular Expressions\n",
    "As a powerful way of searching, replacing, and parsing text with complex patterns of characters, regular expressions are the most significant tools in data parsing. They figure into all kinds of text-manipulation tasks. Searching and search-and-replace are among the most common uses. Regular expressions tend to be easier to write than they are to read. This is less of a problem if you are the only one who ever needs to maintain them. But if several people need to, the syntax can turn into more of a hindrance than an aid. For example,\n",

    "This section will further show you how to parse dates in simple data formats, \n",
    "e.g., mm/dd/yyyy, and dd/mm/yyyy. You might think that something as conceptually trivial as a date should be an easy job for a regular expression. But it isn’t, for reasons like: \n",
    "* The problem of leading zeros: humans are very sloppy with writing dates. Sometimes we omit the leading zeros, and write dates like \"1/1/2016\" and \"1/01/2016\". Therefore, should the regular expression for dates allow leading zeros to be omitted?\n",
    "* Different date delimiters: besides forward slashes, we can also use white spaces, or hyphens to separate day, month and year.\n",
    "* Matching a given range of numbers: regular expressions don't deal directly with numbers and don't understand the numerical meanings that humans assign to strings of digits. They treat numbers, like 123, as strings of characters displayed as digits, 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, we cannot tell a regular expression to match a given range of numbers directly. For instance, to match months that are in a range from 1 to 12 and to match days from 1 to 31.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, you have to choose how simple or how accurate you want your regular expression to be.\n",
    "If you already know your text doesn’t contain any invalid dates, you could use a trivial regex such as\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    r\"\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{4}\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "The fact that this matches things like 00/00/0000 is irrelevant if those don’t occur in your text.\n",
    "In most cases, you won't know whether your text has invalid dates or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "So given that a basic date is day, month and year, and are all digits, which of the three is easiest to parse with regular expressions?\n",

    "## 3. Summary\n",
    "This chapter has discussed the fundamentals of regular expressions.\n",
    "You have learnt how to develop regular expressions for handling street addresses, Roman numerals, phone numbers, and dates. Regular expressions may not be suitable for dealing with complex XML files but the basic idea that a regular expression can block anything that doesn't match is both useful and powerful. You might use regular expressions, for example, as the basis for a short program that filters incoming spam in your email. In this case, the program might use a regular expression to determine whether the name of a known spammer appeared in the \"From:\" line of the email. Email filtering programs, in fact, very often use regular expressions for exactly this type of operation. You will further learn regular expressions in Module 6 on text pre-processing. It is worth noting that regular expressions are not specific to Python. Many other programming languages also provide regular expression capabilities, for example, Perl, Java, Ruby, etc. Finally, do you think it's possibly to do Data Wrangling without regular expressions?\n",

    "## 4. Exercises\n",
    "1.  Write a regular expression to match negative numbers and real-valued numbers, such as -1,023, -10.00, 10.393, and 0.234.\n",
    "1.  Write and test regular expressions for validating days. \n",
    "    1. Just worry about 0 to 31 by assuming all the months can have 31 days\n",
    "    2. Deal with 29, 30 or 31 days, where we distinguish months having 30 days, those having 31 days and assume February always has 29 by treating every year as a leap year.\n",
    "2.  Write regular expressions that can handle date format dd/mm/yyyy, deal with 29, 30, and 31 (as in Exercise 2), \n",
    "    and make the matched day, month and year accessible with group names.\n",
