    "With about a half a billion tweets per day, there’s a lot of data to analyse and to play with.\n",

    "## 1. Collecting Tweets with Python \n",
    "Many web services provide APIs to developers to interact with their services and to access data in a programmatic way.\n",
    "Twitter is one of them.\n",
    "It has taken great care to maintain a well-documented and elegantly simple API that is intuitive and easy to use. \n",
    "There are two types of APIs, i.e., [the Streaming API](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview) and [the REST API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/search), available for Twitter developers.\n",
    "According to the documentation on the Twitter developers' website,\n",
    "the former only sends out real-time tweets. \n",
    "It gives developers low latency access to Twitter’s global stream of Tweet data.\n",
    "The later searches against a sample of recent Tweets published in the past 7 days. \n",
    "It is more suitable for singular searches, such as searching historic tweets, reading user profile information, or posting Tweets.\n",
    "While the Streaming API is focused on matching for completeness, the REST API, like the Twitter search API, is focused on relevance. \n",
    "In this section, you will learn the basic usage of the Twitter search API.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are [many great libraries available]((https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/twitter-libraries) in different programming languages to further ease the work involved in making API requests. \n",
    "Using those libraries, you can easily make API requests without having to know too much\n",
    "about the Twitter API details.\n",
    "Here we will use [TwitterSearch](https://github.com/ckoepp/TwitterSearch), \n",
    "a Python library to easily iterate tweets found by the [Twitter search API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/search),\n",
    "to demonstrate how to make Twitter API requests and download data of our interest, \n",
    "we chose the TwitterSearch library, because it is simple to use, yet supports the Twitter search API well.\n",
    "If you don't have TwitterSearch installed in your machine, go to its Github website and follow\n",
    "the installation instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start with, you need to have a Twitter account and obtain credentials (i.e., consumer key, consumer secret, access token and access token secret) on the Twitter developer site to access the Twitter API.\n",
    "Follow the steps below to get all the 4 credentials:\n",
    "* Create a Twitter user account if you do not already have one.\n",
    "* Go to https://apps.twitter.com/ and log in with your Twitter user account. This step gives you a Twitter developer account under the same name as your user account.\n",
    "* Click “Create New App”, and then fill out the form (i.e., App name, App description, and so on), agree to the terms, and click “Create your Twitter application”.\n",
    "Creating an application is the standard way for a developer to gain API access.\n",
    "The process of creating an application is simple, and all that's needed is read-only access to the API.\n",
    "* In the next page, click on “Keys and Access Tokens” tab on the top, \n",
    "    and copy your “consumer key” and “consumer secret”. \n",
    "* Scroll down if necessary and click “Create my access token”, and copy your “Access token” and “Access token secret”.\n",
    " \n",
    "Below is example code to search Twitter for tweets that have keyword 'metrotrains',\n",
    "and save all the retrieved tweets in list.\n",
    "In order to run the code, you should substituting your own account credentials that you just got above in order to create the TwitterSearch object.\n",

    "[Emoticons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticon), such as 😂,😊,😡,😀, etc. are frequently used tweets and other kinds of online social iterations. They are designed to add emotional flavor to plain text messages, especially in short messages like tweets.\n",
    "Because they are often direct signals of sentiment, emoticons in text have been widely used as features in \n",
    "sentiment analysis or as entries of sentiment lexicons.\n",
    "Given a large amount of tweets posted every day, it would be interesting for businesses and researchers \n",

    "through emoticons, and whether emoticons can be used as a reliable cue for identifying sentiment polarity.\n",
