    "## 1. Data cleansing process:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data cleansing is an iterative process. The first step of the cleansing process is data auditing. In this step, we identify the types of anomalies that reduce the data quality.  Data auditing is about programmatically checking the data using some validation rules that are pre-specified, and then creating a report of the quality of the data and its problems. We often apply some statistical tests in this step for examining the data.\n",
    "Data Anomalies can be classified at a high level into three categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Syntactic Anomalies**: \n",
    "describe characteristics concerning the format and values used for representation of the entities. Syntactic anomalies such as: lexical errors, domain format errors, syntactical error and irregularities.\n",
    "2. **Semantic Anomalies**: \n",
    "hinder the data collection from being a comprehensive and non-redundant representation of the mini-world. These types of anomalies include: Integrity constraint violations, contradictions, duplicates and invalid tuples\n",
    "3. **Coverage Anomalies**: \n",
    "decrease the amount of entities and entity properties from the mini-world that are represented in the data collection. Coverage anomalies are categorized as: missing values and missing tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "We give examples in this part of the auditing process that is applied to discover different anomalies in data.\n",

    "\n",
    "\"The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships. One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class. In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy\". For more details, please refer to \"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic\" \n",
    "\n",
    "The focus here is not the analysis of the data. Instead, we will concentrate on the identification of errors in the data, which might cause problems in the analysis. This data set contains the following variables\n",
