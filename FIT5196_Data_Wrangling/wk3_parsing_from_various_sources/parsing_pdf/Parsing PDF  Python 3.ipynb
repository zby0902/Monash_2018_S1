    "# Parsing PDF Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Portable Document Format ([PDF](https://acrobat.adobe.com/au/en/products/about-adobe-pdf.html)), invented by Adobe, is \"*a file format used to present and exchange documents reliably, independent of software, hardware, or operating system.*\" It is a great format for representing digital documents since each PDF file encapsulates a complete description of the layout of the original document (i.e., the text, fonts, graphics, and other meta information of the document). However, it’s a document representation format and not a data format that is machine readable, like CSV, JSON, and XML. Unfortunately, much of real world data is stored in PDF files, particularly the data published by some government agencies and finance institutions. \n",
    "Here we would also like to point out that if you can avoid having to extract\n",
    "data from PDFs, you should.\n",
    "\n",
    "For data analysis, PDF is not a preferred storage or presentation format. However, sometimes we do not have any other choice. Throughout this chapter, you are going to learn two different ways of scraping data from PDFs with examples. We will cover how to write your own Python scripts, how to use some existing tools, and finally how to save the parsed data into a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example used in this chapter is \"[Table 2: Nutrition](http://www.unicef.org/sowc2014/numbers/documents/english/EN-FINAL%20Table%202.pdf)\" from Unicef's report on [The State of the Worlds Children](http://www.unicef.org/sowc2014/numbers/) for 2014. Click the link to download the pdf file, named \"EN-FINAL Table 2.pdf\" and save it into the same folder as where you stored this notebook. It is the same data as that used in the previous chapter, but in PDF format. The following screenshot shows what the the first page of the PDF file looks like. \n",

    "PDFs are more difficult to work with than Excel files because different PDFs can have different formats that are unpredictable.

There are many ways of extracting data from PDFs. Just to name a few, here is a list of tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [pdfminer](http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/python/pdfminer/): A tool for extracting text, images, object coordinates, metadata from PDF documents. It includes a PDF converter and an extensible PDF parser. \n",
    "* [pdftables](https://github.com/chrisdev/pdftables): A tool for extracting tables from PDF files, it uses pdfminer to get information on the locations of text elements. Each row in the table is extracted and stored in a list.\n",
    "* [slate](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/slate): A Python package that simplifies the process of extracting text from PDF files. It is a small Python module that wraps pdfminer's API.\n",
    "* [PyPDF2](http://mstamy2.github.io/PyPDF2/): A Python library built for manipulating PDFs, such as extracting document information, splitting, merging, and cropping pages, etc.\n",
    "* [Tabula](http://tabula.technology/): A simple tool for extracting data tables out of PDF files. It is quite simple to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to find more tools on Internet! Note that you should search for PDF parsing tools that are capable of extracting data from PDFs, as some parsing tools are not suitable for data extraction.\n",

    "Besides these tools, you can also scrape data from PDF files with many programming languages, like Python. After searching for online tutorials, documentation, and blog post, such as \n",

    "## 1. Scraping data from PDFs with PDFMiner\n",
    "We start with a crude approach in which one first converts PDF to text, and then extracts data for the text using, for example, regular expression. This approach is better if you have a very large PDF file or a series of PDF files that corresponds to a set of consistent documents. We will also show the drawbacks of this approach later in this section. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Converting PDF to Text\n",
    "To convert the downloaded PDF file to a text file, we are going to use *pdf2txt.py*, a command that comes with pdfminer. Let's install pdfminer. In your command line window, type either of the following scripts:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "    pip install pdfminer\n",
    "```\n",
    "or \n",
    "```\n",
    "    conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/hargup pdfminer\n",

    "```shell\n",
    "    make install\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have pdfminer installed and are ready to convert our PDF to text by running the following command:\n",

    "    pdf2txt.py -o en_final_table_2.txt EN_FINAL_Table_2.pdf\n",
    "```\n",
    "The argument `-o` is the text file we want to create, the second argument is the PDF file that we want to convert. After running the above command, we have a text version of the PDF file, i.e., `en_final_table_2.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a moment to skim the txt file and the original PDF file, and have a comparison. What do you find? \n",

    "The text file is quite messy. All the tables have been converted into text form, and the nice table layout shown in the PDF file is lost. Now how can we extract data tables and reconstruct the layout? In the following section, you will learn how to gradually develop a Python script for scraping data from our converted text file. \n",

Since we have written the script to collect all the country names from each PDF page, it should be easy to compute the number of records on each page by inserting a count variable into the same script. Let the count variable be `numRec`. While the script hits the line starting with 'and areas', we set `numRec` to zero.
