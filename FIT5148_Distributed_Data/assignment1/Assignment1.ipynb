    "Divide and broadcast-based parallel join algorithm would be preferable for the join process as the smaller table (climateData) would be broadcasted and the bigger one (fireData) would be divided evenly by the round-robin into several small parts. After this, each small part would be for probing and the climateData table would be for hashing, since we assume we only use 4 processors and each small part then is still larger than the climateDate (only 366 records). The reason why we skipped the disjoint partitioning-based join algorithm for this task is hash data partitioning and range data partitioning. Firstly, the hash-data partitioning would lead to large hash table because the hash-key would be the date attribute. Secondly, range data partitioning would cause serve skew problem (uneven problem) no matter how we distribute the range (based on seasons or just the month or day which can cut the whole table into two relatively even parts)."

For the search part, we simply use a linear search to perform the searching process serially based the join result. One reason is that the joint result is not sorted or not in order, which is not suitable for binary search. Another reason is performing parallel searching requires data partitioning again. Obviously, the complexity of parallel search would be increased if we partition the joint result again then perform linear search parallelly, compared to a simple serially linear search."

    "Since each record in the firedata is quite similar, which means the processing time for each of them can be regarded as the same, thus to make best use of all the processors in the parallized process, it is best to consider round-robin as a data partition method which is the one that can maintains best load-balancing as well as smallest complexity in both terms of time and space as a partition method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I decide to pick `merge sort` as the internal sorting algorithm. For `merge sort` is an identical comparison-based sorting algorithm whose time complexity is O(nlgn) while quick-sort is just quick in implementation but the worst case can be n^2. And both of the two sorting algorithms has the same time complexity since they all use divide and conquer and are divided in a binary way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus in term parallel sorting I am using the merge-sort as the internal sorting method, and the `merge-all` as the technique to merge the sorted list of all processors since the dataset is relatively small thus the burden of the final processor doing the merge-all won't be too large.\n"

    "Round Robin Data Partitioning + Merge-All Group By\n",

    "The reason why we use round robin data partitioning for this task is the same to task2.1 and task 2.2. That is good load balance (even distribution). Hash data partitioning leads to large hash table due to the date (hash key) and range data partitioning causes uneven problem (severe skew issue). \n",
    "\n",
    "For the group by algorithm, we use traditional group by method (merge all group by). This is because the group by attribute is date and redistributing local aggregation results based on date does not change a lot. If we assume four processors would be used, then the parallel time spent on redistribution would be around 25% of the time spent by one processor who performs this redistribution serially. But after that, the global aggregation still requires each processor to do the aggregation parallelly and this would take around the same time to access the redistributed data set. The above explanation about redistribution is based on the current data (fireData), which is not a large data set compared to other data sets in reality. "
